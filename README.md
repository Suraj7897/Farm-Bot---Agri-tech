Building an artificial environment for a plant that can detect any plant placed in it, identify its species and simulating the perfect weather and soil conditions to obtain maximum yield from that plant.


To build an artificial environment for plants which has the capability to identify the plant species and simulate the ideal  conditions required for the plant to grow with maximum yield.
The ideal conditions simulated would be a combination of temperature,water quantity,nutrients in water,humidity and sunlight. Thus the proposed idea is to achieve following objectives  

>data extraction and analysis for facilitating adoption/detection of most appropriate plant development parameters 

 >improve the yield predictive analysis using image processing based machine learning technique

>Disease detection

>Highly optimised and automated, cost effective agriculture by helping farmers to make informed decisions and increase their income and profitability 

> Plant species identification

> Crop quality

> Identify plant and extract the ideal conditions for plant growth, 

> Continuous monitor using image processing and machine learning to adapt the environment,water and other parameters for correct growth 

>Early detection of diseases using image processing and machine learing 

>Automation of all the activities at an optimized cost to ensure maximum benefit for the farmers by improving the yield quality and quantity.
